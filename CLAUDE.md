# Working agreements

## Every screen is responsive. All of them, at every size.

Phones, tablets, and desktops from small laptops to very wide monitors. This is
not a phase, a follow-up ticket, or something the mobile routes get and the
office routes do not. A view is not finished until it works at every width.

**Why this is stated as a rule rather than left to taste:** the people using
this product are a one-or-two-truck business. The owner does the office work on
a laptop in the evening and the field work on a phone in a driveway, often on
the same day, often on the same screen. "Desktop app with a mobile version" is
the wrong model — there is one product and it is used from whatever is in the
person's hand.

### What "works" means, concretely

- **No horizontal page scroll, ever.** Wide content — tables, calendars, code,
  diagrams, wide toolbars — scrolls inside its own `overflow-x: auto` container.
  The page body does not.
- **Touch targets are at least 44px.** Not the icon: the button. See
  `ui/dialog.tsx` and `ui/sheet.tsx` for the pattern — a 16px glyph centred in a
  44px box, so nothing looks different and everything is hittable.
- **Nothing important is hover-only.** Hover does not exist on touch. A control
  that appears on `group-hover` is a control a phone user cannot reach.
- **Dense grids reflow, they do not shrink.** A seven-column week or a
  six-row month laid out as one grid does not become usable by getting smaller;
  below the breakpoint it needs a different shape, not a scaled one.
- **Test the narrow end properly.** 320–360px is a real phone, not an edge
  case. A fixed `w-80` popover overflows a 360px viewport.
- **Landscape and tablet are their own sizes.** A layout that only has "phone"
  and "desktop" branches usually fails between 640 and 1024, which is every
  tablet and every split-screen window.

### Before calling any UI work done

Check it at roughly 360px, 768px, 1280px and 1920px. If a view genuinely cannot
work at one of those widths, say so and say why — do not ship it silently broken
and do not quietly narrow the scope to the widths that happened to work.

Prior art worth reading rather than rediscovering: `docs/mobile-ux-audit.md`
(2026-07-23) audited the staff app against this standard and its findings are
still the best map of where the weak points are.
